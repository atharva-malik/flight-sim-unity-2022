Patch 3.0.3

Added in the still in development Autonomos AI. The aircraft can now follow predefined waypoint tracks
and takeoff when told to do so.

1. Open Takeoff AI scene
2. Play the scene and click the "Start Flight" button. The aircraft will start up and conduct the pre-flight checks,
you can observe from the inspector and watch the systems come on
3. Once the checks are complete, the aircraft will taxi and follow "Runway Track A" (Turn on the gizmos to have a better look)
4. The aircraft will stop at the end of the taxi track and switch to ready mode, click the "Clear for Takeoff" button
to start the takeoff roll
